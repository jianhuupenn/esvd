Title: Exponential-family SVD
Version: 0.0.0.0001
Authors@R: person("Kevin", "Lin", email = "klin1234@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Assuming each row and column of a matrix is associated with a low-dimensional vector, eSVD estimates an embedding for each cell with respect to a hierarchical model where the inner product between the row's and column's latent vectors is the natural parameter of a one-parameter exponential family random variable.
